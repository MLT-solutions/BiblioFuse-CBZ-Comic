## **General Usage Guide**

### **Title:** How to Optimize Your Comic Collection

**1\. Converting a Folder of Images to CBZ**

* If you have a folder named One Piece Ch 100 containing JPGs:  
* Go to the **"Combine Image Folders"** tab.  
* Drag that folder into the list.  
* Set your **Output Filename** (e.g., One Piece Vol 10).  
* **Tip:** If you drag multiple folders (Ch 100, Ch 101, Ch 102), they will be merged into *one single CBZ file* in the order they appear in the list.

**2\. Converting PDFs to CBZ**

* Go to the **"Convert PDFs"** tab.  
* Drag your PDF files in.  
* **Check "Resize Images":** PDFs are often 300DPI (print quality), which is too large for tablets. Set "Max Size" to **1920px** (Fit to Height) for the best balance of quality and file size on an iPad.

**3\. Merging Multiple ZIPs/CBZs**

* Do you have Chapter 1.zip, Chapter 2.zip ... Chapter 10.zip?  
* Go to the **"Combine CBZ/ZIPs"** tab.  
* Drag all 10 zip files into the list.  
* The app will extract images from *all* of them and repack them into a single file.  
* **Performance Tip:** If your source files are already WebP, uncheck "Resize Images" for ultra-fast merging (Direct Stream Copy).

**4\. The Queue System**

* You don't have to wait\! Click "Add to Queue" to line up jobs.  
* You can set up a "Folder" job, then switch tabs and set up a "PDF" job. The app will process them one by one in the background.

### **How to get the best quality vs size:**

1. **For Manga (B\&W):**  
   * **Resize Mode:** "Fit to Shortest Dimension"  
   * **Max Size:** 1440 px (Perfect for iPad Air/Pro) or 1080 px (Perfect for standard tablets/phones).  
   * *Result:* Tiny file size, sharp text.
     
2. **For American Comics (Color):**  
   * **Resize Mode:** "Fit to Height"  
   * **Max Size:** 1920 px.  
   * *Result:* Preserves color detail while reducing file bloat.
     
3. **Merging Chapters:**  
   * If you have One Piece 100.zip, One Piece 101.zip, etc.  
   * Drag them **in order** into the "Combine CBZ/ZIP" tab.  
   * The app will automatically extract all images, re-number them (0001, 0002...), and pack them into one big Volume.cbz.
     
4. **PDF Conversion:**  
   * PDFs often have white borders. The app converts exactly what is on the page.  
   * *Pro Tip:* Use "Fit to Width" if your PDF has wide margins to maximize the visible art on your tablet.
