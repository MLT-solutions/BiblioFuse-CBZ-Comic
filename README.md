### **Description**

**Transform your scattered digital comic collection into a clean, optimized library.**

**BiblioFuse: Comic Binder** is the power tool for manga collectors and digital archivists. It takes messy folders of images, bulky PDFs, and loose ZIP archives and "binds" them into perfectly formatted, tablet-ready CBZ files.

Using advanced **WebP compression**, it reduces file sizes by up to 50% while maintaining crystal-clear quality for iPad, Android, and Kindle Fire screens.

### **Why You Need This**

* **Recover Disk Space:** Convert massive JPEG/PNG collections to high-efficiency WebP.  
* **Read on Any Device:** Create standard CBZ files compatible with CDisplayEx, Panels, Chunky, and Kuro Reader.  
* **Merge Volumes:** Combine "Chapter 1.zip" through "Chapter 5.zip" into a single "Volume 1.cbz".
